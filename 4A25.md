Congrats! You've reached the final part of this sprint. In this part, you will put your newly acquired skills to the test by creating a quality assurance algorithm for digital image processing. This project will challenge you to integrate everything you've learned during this sprint into play.

For this assignment, you'll need to develop an algorithm that assesses the quality of produced images. Use your knowledge of image processing techniques to identify key quality metrics, design tests to evaluate these metrics, and iteratively refine your approach based on your findings. We encourage you to apply your critical thinking skills to determine the most important aspects of product quality, design appropriate tests, and explore various methods to achieve the best results.


## Objectives



* Practice conducting EDA for image dataset.
* Practice designing and implementing tests to evaluate product quality. 
* Practice applying image processing techniques for quality assessment.
* Practice iteratively refining algorithms based on test results.
* Practice integrating multiple image processing techniques into a robust algorithm.

## Requirements



* Download data for [quality inspection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ravirajsinh45/real-life-industrial-dataset-of-casting-product). Only 1300 images from the `casting_512x512` directory will be used.
* Conduct EDA on images.
* Create 3 partition data splits with 30% of images that will be used for understanding the digital images and their respective important features, 30% of images for validation which would give the ability to select the best performing approach and 40% of images that will be only used ONCE for testing. 
* Build an algorithm using any digital image processing techniques for robust classification into defective and proper metal castings.
* Evaluate the best performing algorithm on the test dataset and make a classification report. Evaluate the best performing algorithms processing time.
* Implement an additional feature for the best performing algorithm with the ability to highlight defective points with a bounding box if the classifier detects any defect.
* Give suggestions on how to improve the algorithm even further.

## Evaluation Criteria



* Data cleaning. Were the data properly cleaned: duplicates identified, corruptions omitted?
* Adherence to the requirements. How well did you meet the requirements?
* Depth of your analysis. Did you just skim the surface or did you explore the dataset in depth?
* Algorithmâ€™s classification performance. How robust did your algorithm perform the predictions?
* Code quality. Was your code well-structured? Did you use the appropriate levels of abstraction? Did you remove commented out and unused code? Did you adhere to the PEP8?
* Code performance. Did you use the suitable algorithms and data structures to solve the problems?

## Project review

During your project review, you should present your project as if talking to your friend, who is a senior data scientist. Present the techniques that you applied and why you have chosen them. Explain what are the possible areas of improvement.

During a project review, you may get asked questions that test your understanding of covered topics:



* What image processing techniques did you use for feature extraction?
* How did you handle variations in image quality and lighting conditions?
* Can you explain the steps for training and validating your model?
* How does your algorithm identify and highlight defective regions in the images?
